Version: 0.1
Author: Andriy Derkach, Ruth Pfeiffer

Description: We develop a flexible procedure (STAMP) based on mixture 
models to perform region based meta-analysis of different phenotypes 
using data from different GWAS and identify subsets of associated 
phenotypes. To run variance-component (quadratic test) under mixture 
model use mixtureQuad and mixtureLinear to run for 
burden (linear) tests.
